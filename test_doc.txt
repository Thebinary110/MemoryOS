Authentication Best Practices Guide

Introduction to Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying user identity in web applications.

Common Authentication Methods
1. Basic Authentication - Uses username and password
2. Token-based Authentication - Uses JWT tokens
3. OAuth 2.0 - Industry standard for authorization
4. Multi-factor Authentication - Additional security layer

Security Best Practices
- Always use HTTPS for transmitting credentials
- Hash passwords using bcrypt or argon2
- Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
- Use secure session management
- Enable multi-factor authentication when possible
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Implement proper password complexity requirements

OAuth 2.0 Implementation
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts.
Key components include authorization server, resource server, and client application.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
JWT is a compact way to securely transmit information between parties as a JSON object.
Contains header, payload, and signature sections.
